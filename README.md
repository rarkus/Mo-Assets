We have a Q&A below! If you have any basic questions they should be answered below!

Q: What is the goal behind this repository?<br>A: The goal is to make a streamlined community contributed Rain World modding resource for everyone to enjoy! Documenting and Archiving as much as we can!

Q: Why shouldn't I use alternatives?<br>A: Here at Mo' Assets we make sure everyone is heard! If you have an issue with anything you can join the Discord and talk about it there! Even has a forums channel for feedback and issues.

Q: Will I be credited if I donate anything?<br>A: Yes! I will make sure to credit everyone properly to the best of my ability as soon as the assets are added.

Q: Can I redistribute Mo' Assets exclusive content?<br>A: No, I would not like you to do that, you may contact me and ask if you'd like but the answer is most likely no. If you would like to redistribute non Mo' Assets exclusive content please ask the original creator unless they have specified it's free use.

Q: Can you change something you did with my assets? I don't like it.<br>A: DM me! I'll work with you to get it to your liking!

Q: If I want my assets removed, how would I go about getting my assets removed?<br>A: DM me through discord @rwslugcat and I will remove everything asap no questions asked! What you want done with your assets is important, as you made them not anyone else!

Q: How do you handle obtaining assets that aren't directly donated to you?<br>A: If contactable I will contact them and ask them for permission, If someone is completely uncontactable by normal terms after trying to contact them I will put their assets in the repository, and if they ever are contactable I will contact them and ask.
